Git is the backbone of modern software development. Whether you're working solo or with a team, mastering these fundamental Git commands will streamline your workflow and make version control second nature.

Version control is essential for tracking changes, collaborating with others, and maintaining a clean project history. Let's dive into the core Git commands that every developer should have in their toolkit.

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Check the status of your working directory
git status
```

These commands form the foundation of Git usage. `git init` creates a new repository, `git clone` copies an existing one, and `git status` shows you what's happening in your current working directory.

## Working with Changes

The most common Git workflow involves adding, committing, and pushing changes. Here's how to handle your day-to-day operations:

```bash
# Add files to staging area
git add filename.txt
git add .  # Add all files

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push changes to remote repository
git push origin main
```

Understanding the staging area is crucial. Files go through three stages: working directory, staging area, and committed. The `git add` command moves files to staging, `git commit` saves them to your local repository, and `git push` uploads them to the remote repository.

## Branching and Merging

Branches allow you to work on different features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. This is where Git truly shines:

1. Create and switch branches
2. Merge completed features
3. Delete unnecessary branches
4. Handle merge conflicts
5. Keep your branch history clean

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch

# Switch to the branch
git checkout feature-branch

# Create and switch in one command
git checkout -b new-feature

# Merge branch back to main
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

Branching strategies like Git Flow or GitHub Flow help teams coordinate their work. The key is to keep branches focused on single features or bug fixes.

## Essential Status and History Commands

Knowing what's happening in your repository is crucial for effective Git usage:

```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline

# See differences in files
git diff

# Show specific commit details
git show commit-hash

# View remote repositories
git remote -v
```

These commands help you understand your project's history and current state. The `git log` command is particularly powerful with various formatting options to display commit history exactly how you need it.

Git mastery comes with practice, but these fundamental commands will handle 90% of your version control needs. Start with these basics, and gradually explore more advanced features like rebasing, stashing, and advanced merging strategies.
